# iota-python

iota is a small programming language.

iota-python is the base for python-based implementations and tools for iota.

This includes:
- sip, a serial interface to iota systems written in python
- chip, a CircuitPython implementation of iota for microcntrollers

There is nothing to run here, these are the base classes needed for the actual implementations.
